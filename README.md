ERC 20 Standard Followed :

Note : This Project is an Extension of ERC Token SKP which was a POC. So with Extended funcationality, I am trying to include Exchange functionality along with rich UI so that we can use it deplosite Order withdraw of the token. I am Planning to deploy this Smart Contract on Kovan Test Net.
